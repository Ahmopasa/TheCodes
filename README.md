# TheCodes

* Codes, that I saw/wrote on the Internet. So, I cannot own all of their rights... 
* This repository mainly includes C, C++ and C# codes and has been created for learning purposes.
     * As time goes on, which means that I'll see/write more code pieces, new ones will be added. 
* For testing purposes, I have added Golang and Python codes as well.

## Installation

* I tried not to add any .exe, or any project specific file here. So, just source codes have been included.

## Usage
* I do not see a situation where the codes here should not be used without permission. However, my advice to you is to avoid one-to-one use. I find it more appropriate to use it for inspiration.
